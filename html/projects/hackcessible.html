            <h1>Hackcessible</h1>
            <p>
                This project, part of the Hackcessible event, involved creating assistive technology to help an individual enjoy playing drums. The main goal was to design and build a system using Arduino to enhance accessibility and provide a solution for physical challenges. The project was a collaborative effort, and I had the opportunity to apply my skills in coding and problem-solving.
