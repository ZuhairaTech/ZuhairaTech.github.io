            <h1>Viridis: Predictive Reporting and User Interface</h1>
            <p>
                The Viridis project was a team-based endeavor where we worked with a client to understand their requirements and create a scalable solution. I was part of a 6-7 member team and actively contributed to the implementation of key features. The goal was to develop a platform that would allow staff to generate predictive reports and insights, ultimately enhancing customer presentations.

                    <p>
                        In the first semester, our team worked closely with the client to gather requirements, which involved both online and offline meetings. We created mockups and refined them based on feedback from the client to better understand their needs. We used these insights to create a robust platform focused on generating predictive reports and providing insights that were easy to interpret.

                        I led the implementation of several key features in the project, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Secure User Authentication:</strong> Ensured that only authorized users could access sensitive data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Robust Database Management:</strong> Created and managed the database to support the platform's scalability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dynamic Administrator Interface:</strong> Developed an interface that improved user experience by providing quick access to data and graphical reports.</li>
                        </ul>
                        We used Ruby on Rails for backend development, which allowed us to create a scalable solution that could handle large datasets and generate predictive reports efficiently.
