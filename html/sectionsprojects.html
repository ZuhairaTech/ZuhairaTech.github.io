    <h1>Viridis: Predictive Reporting and User Interface</h1>
    <p>
        The Viridis project was a team-based endeavor where we worked with a client to understand their requirements and create a scalable solution. I was part of a 6-7 member team and actively contributed to the implementation of key features. The goal was to develop a platform that would allow staff to generate predictive reports and insights, ultimately enhancing customer presentations.

            <p>
                In the first semester, our team worked closely with the client to gather requirements, which involved both online and offline meetings. We created mockups and refined them based on feedback from the client to better understand their needs. We used these insights to create a robust platform focused on generating predictive reports and providing insights that were easy to interpret.

    <h1>Garden Planning Add-on</h1>
    <p>
        The Garden Planning Add-on for Blender enables users to simulate the growth of various plants through computational models. 
        Using Python scripting in Blender, this add-on creates dynamic plant structures, simulating growth patterns for plants like sunflowers and baby's breath. 
        The add-on leverages L-systems and randomization to generate plant branching, offering a glimpse into nature's beauty through code.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <div>
        <p>In this project, L-systems were adapted to generate plant growth models in Blender using Python scripting. 
           Growth patterns such as branching angles, plant height, and radius were controlled based on predefined rules for each plant type such as below:</p>
        <pre><code>
            plants_rules = {
                "SUNFLOWER": {
                        "angle_of_branching": 0,  # degrees
                        "radius": 0.1,
                        "height": 0.5,
                    },
                "BABYSBREATH": {
                        "angle_of_branching": 1,  # degrees
                        "radius": 0.01,
                        "height": 0.2,
                    },
                # Add more plant types as needed
            }

              Project Summary
            </h4>
            <p class="project-description">This project explores a simplified approach to rule-based branching inspired by L-systems, adapted for easier use with Blender and Python. It focuses on developing a tool for garden planning that allows users to design and visualise layouts efficiently while maintaining a user-friendly experience. Blender was used for 3D modelling and Python for scripting. Although the tool is functional, it remains a work in progress, with future updates aimed at enhancing its capabilities and performance in more complex settings. The modular nature of the system makes it adaptable for other uses beyond garden planning. Planned improvements include refining plant models—particularly for sunflowers and baby's breath—by using more realistic growth rules, incorporating environmental factors, expanding the use of L-systems to simulate various natural forms, improving randomness to better reflect natural growth, and enhancing 3D visualisation and overall performance for larger simulations.
