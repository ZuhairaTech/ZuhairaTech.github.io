    <h1>Viridis: Predictive Reporting and User Interface</h1>
    <p>
        The Viridis project was a team-based endeavor where we worked with a client to understand their requirements and create a scalable solution. I was part of a 6-7 member team and actively contributed to the implementation of key features. The goal was to develop a platform that would allow staff to generate predictive reports and insights, ultimately enhancing customer presentations.

            <p>
                In the first semester, our team worked closely with the client to gather requirements, which involved both online and offline meetings. We created mockups and refined them based on feedback from the client to better understand their needs. We used these insights to create a robust platform focused on generating predictive reports and providing insights that were easy to interpret.

    <h1>Garden Planning Add-on</h1>
    <p>
        The Garden Planning Add-on for Blender enables users to simulate the growth of various plants through computational models. 
        Using Python scripting in Blender, this add-on creates dynamic plant structures, simulating growth patterns for plants like sunflowers and baby's breath. 
        The add-on leverages L-systems and randomization to generate plant branching, offering a glimpse into nature's beauty through code.
